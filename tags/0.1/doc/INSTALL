Before being able to use the application, you'll have to install a new keys DB. 
Go to the "sql" directory in the package and run:
    
    $ ./create_db.sh
    
Afterwards you should have your DB created at "~/.chatstore". Type ".quit" to exit
sqlite3.  

Now you can compile the application
    
    $ make
    

That's all.
