rsachat
========
It's all about a project I had to implement at the university some years
ago. Basically *rsachat* is a RSA based chat which lacks of proper 
security features, e.g. replay attacks etc. Don't *ever* think this 
tool might be secure enough. It is **not**! It was implemented just for 
educational purposes.
